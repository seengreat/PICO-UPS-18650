PICO-UPS-18650 from seengreat:www.seengreat.com
 =======================================
# Ⅰ  Instructions
## 1.1、Overview
This product is an UPS uninterruptible power supply expansion board for Raspberry Pi Pico , working with 18650 lithium battery, which can be identified the working status of the UPS board through different LED displays. There are "charging mode", "discharge mode", and "warning mode for battery reverse connection ". This UPS board also has an independent power supply, which can realize charging while discharging or only charging. The board features a battery detection function. When the battery is reversed, the alarm warning light is on, and the UPS board does not work. We provide demo codes of C and python that can detect voltage, current, power and electricity.<br>

## 1.4、Notice for Usage of Lithium Battery
①If our company's products are not equipped with batteries, customers should according to the description of batteries in the product manual choose to purchase lithium batteries from regular manufacturers, please read the battery manufacturer's manual carefully before use, to ensure that it is compatible with the purchased product module, observe the battery polarity, understand the environment of battery use, and remember the battery life;<br>
②Before using the battery, please check whether the product and the contact parts of the battery are clean, wipe them with a damp cloth if necessary, and put them into the battery holder according to the correct polarity direction after drying; <br>
③Children are not allowed to replace batteries without adult supervision; <br>
④Do not mix new and old batteries or different types of batteries, especially dry batteries and rechargeable batteries; <br>
⑤Do not short circuit the rechargeable battery, otherwise it will damage the battery, and it will heat and make the battery burn; <br>
⑥Do not disassemble the battery, or try to penetrate the battery with a sharp object, because the electrolyte inside the battery will hurt your skin and clothes; <br>
⑦Turn off the power output after using this product to avoid heat and fire; <br>
⑧Can not reverse charge, reverse charge is equivalent to over discharge, over discharge will make the battery internal adverse reactions and lead to serious damage to the battery, generate a large number of gases, probably to make the rechargeable battery chemical leakage; <br>
⑨Battery should be kept in a cool, dry place, avoid direct sunlight, and can not be mixed with metal objects, the insulating film wrapped outside shall not be torn off at will, the battery with the insulating film removed is mixed with metal objects, which may cause short circuit of the battery, leading to leakage, discharge, explosion, fire and personal injury; If the battery is not used for a long time, it should be saved after the battery is emptied, and take it out for charging and discharging one time every 3 months.<br>
